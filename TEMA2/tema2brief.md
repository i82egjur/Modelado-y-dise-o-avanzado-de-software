## The concept of architecture


### Software architecture. Three _important_ concepts

- Ideally:
  - Responsabilities -> ***LOW***  
  - Cohesión -> ***HIGH***
  - Connection -> ***LOW***
 
- At any abstraction level, there are important aspects and decisions related to
  software architecture.
   
- A software architect/engineer should feel comfortable working at any abstraction level, from
  the highest to the lowest.
  
- Software design pattern is a _general and reusable_ solution to a commonly ocurring problem 
  whitin a given context in _software design_. It is not a finished design that can be transformed.
  directly into _source_ or _machine code_. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be
  used in many different situations.
  
- Architectural pattern. Collection of _architectural design decisions_ that are applicable to a recurring problem as well as parameterized,
  and might be _considered in different software development contexts_ in which the problem may appear.
  
  - Architectural style. Collection of _architectural decisions_ defined by the same denomination that are _applicable to a given development context_. **34 END***
  
  
  #### AT ANY LEVEL 
  
  Continuing with higher abstraction levels...
  - Software architecture. Structure of structures of a 35 END
  
  
 - Global system architecture. It describes the organization of the system expressed in terms of its components, the relationships beet 36 END


- Architecture framework. Related to the component


¿What are the objectives of the software architecture?

- Identify the main modules of the system and not to think about the immplementation
- Identify the functionality and responsabilities of each module.
- Define the possible interactions between the modules through control mechanisms and data flows, inforation seqencing, interaction and communication protocols etc.

Why is S.A. so important?

It makes easier to understand complex systems

Its representation eases the communication.
Descriptions ca be reused on a large scale
The architectural description highlights (TERMINAR)

## Architectural design.
Prior step to the entire design, this is the dirst step in the design of a system, prior to the detailed design. The result is known as software architecture.

This represents the link between the requirements specification and the design.
(Terminar)

Large system are split up into subsystes.
Each subsystem provides a set of related services
In a initial process,
  - Subsystems are (TERMINAR)

From the point of vien of a software designer, block diagrams are not useful architectural representations:
- The do not represent relationships betwenn the components of the system nor the externally visible properties of the components.
- From the point of viwe of the communicaation between stakeholders, block diagrams are useful:
  - Since the do not represent unnecessary details, the allow stakeholders to have an abstract viwn of the system.
- From the point of vien of planning and project managers, block diagrams are usefull.

Architectural design, is a creative process, the process activities differ according to:
- Type of system to be  developed.
- Experience and knolege of the architect.
- Specific requirements of the process.


This is a decision-centered process.
Is there a generic architecture that acts as a template for  the system we are designing

The result of the architectural design process is an architectural design report including graphical representations of the system together with some usefu explanations.
- An architecture should be designed and documented form different point of views
- The architectural design is an iterative but ordered process:
- Representation of the system whitin its context.


Representation of the system whitin its context.

Which entities exit ....


2 Definition of gesign elements.

The elements of design are stady elements that can be instantiated in many ways, depending on the system behavior. these elements are initially instantiate.


Refinement of the architecture.

For each component it is necessary to define and refine its behavior (for example, with state diagrams).

When to stop at the "optimal design"?

- The representation must comply with functonal reqirements.
- The representation must comply whith performance and other non-functional requirements.
- It is often possible to derive, refine and evaluate alternative architectural styles.
- Structural simplicity
